    <h1>Scene 1</h1>
    <p>As you make your way into the island, you come across a river.</p>
    
    <img src="waterfall.jpg" class="center">
    <h2> Choice A </h2>
    <p>If you choose to try to cross the river, you'll have to find a suitable place to do so. You search along the bank and finally find a spot where the water is shallow enough to wade across. However, as you make your way across, you slip on a rock and fall into the river. You manage to cling onto a branch that's hanging over the water, but now you're soaking wet, and your map is ruined.</p>
    <h3> Choice B </h3>
    <p>If you choose to follow the river, you come across a waterfall that's stunningly beautiful. The water cascades down from a height of about 30 feet, and you can see that there's a cave behind it. You have to decide whether to climb up to the top of the waterfall and see what's behind it or follow the river further downstream.</p>
    <p1>You have to choose any one option</p1>
    <button id="option1">Choose A</button>
    <button id="option2">Choice B</button>

    <div id="popup"></div>

    <script>
      const option1Button = document.getElementById("option1");
      const option2Button = document.getElementById("option2");
      const popup = document.getElementById("popup");

      option1Button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        window.open("./Choice a.html", "_blank");
  
      });

      option2Button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        window.open("./Choice b.html", "_blank");
    

      });

    </script>
