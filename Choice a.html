    <h1>Cross the Road </h1>
    <img src="trible people.jpg.crdownload" class="center">
    <p>If you decide to cross the river downstream, you'll come across a tribe of indigenous people. They're friendly and invite you to stay with them for a while. You learn that they know about the lost treasure, but they believe it belongs to the island and should not be taken by anyone. </p>
    <h2> Choice A </h2>
    <p>If you decide to take the treasure for yourself, you'll have to fight off the angry tribe members who see you as a thief. You manage to escape with the treasure, but you leave the island with a heavy heart and a sense of guilt for disrespecting the tribe's beliefs.</p>
    <h3> Choice B </h3>
    <p>If you decide to respect the wishes of the tribe, you'll return to the mainland empty-handed, but with a newfound respect for the people who call this island their home.</p>
    <p>You have to choose any one option</p>
    <button id="option1">Fight with them </button>
    <button id="option2">Leave the treasure</button>
